## Prompt

```text
 Create a comprehensive project constitution that governs the entire
5-phase lifecycle of this hackathon project.

This constitution must align with:
- Hackathon evaluation standards
- Spec-Kit Plus philosophy
- Spec-Driven Development
- Agentic, AI-native workflows using Claude Code

====================
PROJECT SCOPE
====================

This constitution applies to ALL phases (Phase 1 through Phase 5)
of the project and must remain stable across the entire hackathon.

Phase-specific details will live in individual specifications,
but this constitution defines the permanent rules, principles,
and governance model.

====================
CORE PHILOSOPHY
====================

This project follows Spec-Driven Vibe-Coding:

- Specifications are the primary artifact
- Code is a derived artifact generated by AI
- Human responsibility is architectural thinking,
  constraint definition, validation, and review

The constitution must emphasize that:
- Writing specs is more important than writing code
- AI is a collaborator, not an autopilot
- Correctness, clarity, and intent matter more than speed

====================
DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES
====================

Define principles covering:

1. Spec-First Development
   - No code before specs
   - Specs define behavior, not implementation
   - Specs are versioned and immutable once approved

2. Phase Isolation with Forward Compatibility
   - Each phase must be independently runnable
   - Later phases may extend but must not break earlier phases
   - All phases live in a single repository with clear boundaries

3. Agentic Discipline
   - The AI agent must follow explicit workflows
   - No skipped steps (spec → plan → tasks → implement)
   - No unapproved feature introduction

4. Human-in-the-Loop Governance
   - Humans approve specs and transitions between phases
   - Humans validate correctness and intent
   - Humans remain accountable for outcomes

====================
ARCHITECTURAL GOVERNANCE
====================

The constitution must establish rules for:

- Clean project structure
- Separation of concerns
- Modularity and extensibility
- Deterministic behavior
- Explicit error handling

It must state that:
- Early phases may be simple, but never sloppy
- Design decisions must be documented
- Trade-offs must be explicit

====================
AI USAGE RULES
====================

Clearly define how AI is used:

- AI generates specs, plans, tasks, and code
- AI must explain reasoning between phases
- AI must not hallucinate requirements
- AI must not bypass guardrails

AI output must always be:
- Reviewable
- Traceable to a spec
- Aligned with acceptance criteria

====================
QUALITY STANDARDS
====================

Define non-negotiable quality bars:

- Readability over cleverness
- Explicit behavior over implicit assumptions
- Predictable CLI interfaces
- Consistent naming and structure
- Minimal but sufficient documentation

====================
DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
====================

The constitution must require:

- A README explaining phases and usage
- A CLAUDE.md explaining agent usage
- Maintained spec history
- Architecture and decision records when needed

====================
HACKATHON ALIGNMENT
====================

Explicitly state that the goal is to demonstrate:

- Spec-driven thinking
- AI-native development maturity
- Architectural foresight
- Clean evolution across phases
- Professional engineering judgment

====================
TONE & FORMAT
====================

- Write in clear, authoritative language
- Avoid marketing fluff
- Sound like a real engineering constitution
- Use numbered sections and bullet points
- Keep it concise but complete

====================
OUTPUT
====================

Produce a single file named:

constitution.md

This constitution must be suitable for evaluation by judges
as evidence of disciplined, AI-native software engineering.
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (version 1.0.0) with:

**7 Core Principles:**
1. Spec-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
2. Phase Isolation with Forward Compatibility
3. Agentic Workflow Discipline
4. Human-in-the-Loop Governance
5. Clean Architecture and Modularity
6. Deterministic and Observable Behavior
7. Simplicity and YAGNI

**3 Major Sections:**
- Development Workflow (5 workflow gates: specify → plan → tasks → implement → commit)
- Quality Standards (code, documentation, testing)
- AI Usage Rules (responsibilities, constraints, output standards)

**Documentation Requirements:**
- README.md, CLAUDE.md, spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md
- Prompt History Records (PHRs) routing
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) policy

**Hackathon Alignment:**
- Demonstrates spec-driven thinking
- Shows AI-native development maturity
- Exhibits architectural foresight
- Reflects professional engineering judgment

Constitution includes Sync Impact Report showing initial creation, template compatibility verification, and semantic versioning at 1.0.0.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive governance framework for 5-phase hackathon project. Establishes mandatory workflows, quality standards, and AI collaboration rules.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (governance document)
- 📁 Files: Created/updated `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (327 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for `/sp.specify` to create Phase 1 feature specification, following the spec-first principle
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully balances hackathon agility with professional rigor. Key innovation is explicit phase isolation requirement, ensuring judges can evaluate phases independently. AI usage rules establish clear human-in-the-loop governance while enabling efficient AI collaboration.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Manual review - PASS (all placeholders resolved, principles comprehensive, hackathon-aligned)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (initial creation)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor template consistency during first feature specification to validate constitution-template alignment
